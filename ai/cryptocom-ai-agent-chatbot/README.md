## Features

- Real-time chatbot interface for interacting with the Crypto.com AI Agent API.
- Integrated with **OpenAI** for processing natural language queries.
- Easy-to-use front end for querying blockchain services like retrieving block data, checking wallet balances, and more.
- Built with **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.
- **React + TypeScript**: Fully typed for better developer experience.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/developer-platform-sdk-examples.git
    cd ai/cryptocom-ai-agent-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of `ai/cryptocom-ai-agent-chatbot`. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for the required variables:

   ```bash
   VITE_OPEN_AI_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   VITE_EXPLORER_API_KEY=<your-explorer-api-key>
   VITE_BASE_API_URL=<cryptocom-ai-agent-service-base-url>

   These environment variables will configure the app to communicate with the Crypto.com AI Agent Service API.
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the chatbot in action.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate the static files in the `dist` folder, optimized for deployment.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot in real-time. The chatbot is connected to the **Crypto.com AI Agent Service**, which processes your queries and returns blockchain data or executes blockchain commands.

### Example Queries

You can try some example queries such as:

- **"What's the latest block?"**
- **"Check balance for address 0x...?"**
- **"Fetch transaction details for hash 0x...?"**

The responses are generated using OpenAI's NLP model, and the application then interacts with the blockchain using the Crypto.com Developer Platform.
