Hereâ€™s a simple README for the `ai` folder within the `developer-repository-sdk` repository, which will contain example AI applications:

---

# AI Example Apps

This folder contains example applications demonstrating how to integrate and interact with AI capabilities using the **Crypto.com Developer Platform**.

## Overview

The AI example apps in this directory showcase various use cases of integrating AI-powered services, such as natural language processing (NLP), blockchain queries, and intelligent responses using the **Crypto.com Developer Platform**.

## Structure

Each sub-folder contains an example AI application with code, configurations, and instructions on how to run and explore the use cases.

### Example App 1: AI Query Handler

This example demonstrates how to create an AI query handler that sends user inputs to the AI Agent and retrieves intelligent responses.

- **Folder**: `./ai-query-handler`
- **Functionality**: Send natural language queries to the Crypto.com AI Agent and receive responses based on blockchain data and actions.

### Example App 2: AI Token Balance Checker

This example shows how to use AI to check token balances by asking natural language questions.

- **Folder**: `./ai-balance-checker`
- **Functionality**: Ask the AI agent about token balances for a given address, and it retrieves the information directly from the blockchain.
